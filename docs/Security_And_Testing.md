# AetherVisor: Security and Testing Strategy

This document outlines the multi-layered security approach and the testing methodologies required to ensure the stability, security, and undetectability of the AetherVisor project.

## 1. Security Layers (Defense in Depth)

The security model is designed to make detection by anti-cheat systems like Hyperion as difficult as possible. This involves a combination of kernel-mode and user-mode techniques.

### 1.1. Kernel-Mode Security (The Driver)
- **Objective:** Bypass kernel-level anti-cheat sensors and provide secure primitives for the user-mode components.
- **Techniques:**
    - **Dynamic Driver Loading:** The driver will not be registered permanently. It will be loaded on-demand and its entry in the system's loaded modules list will be masked.
    - **IOCTL Obfuscation:** The I/O Control (IOCTL) codes used for communication between the user-mode backend and the kernel driver will be dynamically generated and not use a predictable pattern.
    - **ETW & DbgPrint Suppression:** The driver will detect and disable Event Tracing for Windows (ETW) providers and debug print functions that are commonly used by anti-cheats to monitor system behavior.
    - **Process/Thread Concealment:** The driver will provide functionality to hide the AetherVisor backend process and its threads from enumeration by the anti-cheat.

### 1.2. User-Mode Security (The Backend & Injected DLL)
- **Objective:** Avoid user-mode scanning, debugging, and tampering.
- **Techniques:**
    - **Manual DLL Mapping:** The user-mode payload (DLL) will be manually mapped into Roblox's memory instead of using the standard `LoadLibrary` call. This bypasses common module enumeration techniques.
    - **Memory Obfuscation:** Critical functions and strings within the injected DLL will be encrypted at rest and only decrypted during execution to prevent signature scanning of the process memory.
    - **Anti-Debugging:** The backend process will employ standard anti-debugging techniques (e.g., `IsDebuggerPresent`, checking timing discrepancies) to prevent analysis.
    - **Handle Hijacking:** Handles to the Roblox process will be opened from the kernel driver and passed to the user-mode backend, avoiding the need for the backend to call `OpenProcess` directly, which is a heavily monitored API call.

## 2. Testing Strategy

Testing must be rigorous and cover functionality, security, and stability.

### 2.1. Unit Testing
- **Scope:** Individual functions and classes in isolation.
- **Backend (C++):** A framework like Google Test will be used to test parsing logic, data structures, and non-OS-dependent utility functions.
- **Frontend (C#):** A framework like MSTest or NUnit will be used to test ViewModel logic, command behavior, and service implementations. Mocks will be used for dependencies (e.g., mock IPC service).

### 2.2. Integration Testing
- **Scope:** Testing the interaction between different components.
- **Key Scenarios:**
    - **Frontend <-> Backend:** Verify that IPC messages are correctly sent, received, and deserialized. Test the full lifecycle from handshake to shutdown.
    - **Backend <-> Driver:** Verify that IOCTL calls work as expected and that kernel primitives (e.g., memory reads/writes) are successful.
    - **Backend -> Roblox:** Test the entire injection chain, from process discovery to successful payload execution.

### 2.3. Security Testing (Red Team Approach)
- **Scope:** Actively trying to defeat our own security measures.
- **Methods:**
    - **Signature Scanning:** Use popular antivirus and anti-malware tools to scan all compiled artifacts (driver, backend, DLL) to check for detections.
    - **Reverse Engineering:** Use tools like IDA Pro, x64dbg, and Cheat Engine to attempt to find and analyze the injected DLL within the Roblox process.
    - **Behavioral Analysis:** Use monitoring tools like Process Monitor and Wireshark (for local traffic) to look for suspicious activity patterns that an anti-cheat might flag.

### 2.4. Performance and Stability Testing
- **Objective:** Ensure the tool does not cause performance degradation or system instability.
- **Methods:**
    - **Memory Leak Detection:** Run the application for extended periods while monitoring memory usage to detect leaks in both the C++ backend and the C# frontend.
    - **Stress Testing:** Execute very large scripts or a high frequency of small scripts to test the performance of the script execution engine and the IPC channel.
    - **Game Performance Monitoring:** Monitor Roblox's frame rate (FPS) and CPU/GPU usage with and without AetherVisor injected to ensure the performance impact is negligible.
