# AetherVisor: Advanced Testing Strategy for Adaptive Systems
**Version 4.0 ("Detailed" Release Candidate)**

This document outlines the testing strategy for all systems within the AetherVisor project, updated to cover the final "Detailing" phase of development.

## 1. Testing Philosophy

The system is a complex, non-deterministic, adaptive, and deeply obfuscated application. Testing requires a multi-faceted approach focusing on behavioral verification, state inspection, component isolation, and foundational architecture validation.

## 2. Test Scenarios - Previous Phases (Recap)

- AI, Polymorphism, Network Mimicry, Signature Scanning, Trampoline Hooks, Steganography, and foundational VM/ML skeletons have been tested per previous versions of this document.

## 3. Test Scenarios - Phase 4 ("Detailing") Features

### 3.1. Maximum Polymorphism (`PolymorphicEngine`)
- **Objective:** Verify the new, more advanced code mutation techniques.
- **Scenario 1 (Instruction Substitution):**
    1. Create a sample byte vector containing the `inc eax` opcode (`0x40`).
    2. Pass this vector to the `PolymorphicEngine::SubstituteInstructions` method.
    3. **Expected Result:** The original `0x40` byte should be replaced by the 3-byte NOP sequence (`0x0F 0x1F 0x00`), and the vector's size should increase by 2. This confirms the find-and-replace logic is working.
- **Scenario 2 (Full String Encryption):**
    1. After compiling the final DLL, run a `strings` utility or use a hex editor on the binary.
    2. Search for any of the previously hardcoded strings (e.g., `"[PRINT]: "`, `"Matrix access out of bounds"`).
    3. **Expected Result:** None of these strings should appear in plaintext in the final binary.

### 3.2. Functional Virtual Machine (`VirtualMachine` & `Compiler`)
- **Objective:** Verify that the simple compiler can generate correct bytecode and the VM can execute it.
- **Scenario:**
    1. Create an instance of the `Compiler` and the `VirtualMachine`.
    2. Call `compiler.Compile("5 + 10")`.
    3. Pass the resulting bytecode to `vm.Run()`.
    4. After execution, inspect the VM's stack.
    5. **Expected Result:** The top value on the stack should be the integer `15`. This verifies the entire compiler-VM pipeline for a simple case.

### 3.3. Realistic Behavioral Cloner (`Layer`)
- **Objective:** Verify that the non-linear activation functions are correctly applied.
- **Scenario:**
    1. Create a `Layer` instance, passing `&Matrix::relu` as the activation function.
    2. Create a 1x2 input `Matrix` with values `[10.0, -5.0]`.
    3. Call the `layer.forward(input)` method.
    4. Inspect the output matrix.
    5. **Expected Result:** The output matrix (before weight multiplication) should be `[10.0, 0.0]`, as `relu` changes negative values to zero. This confirms the activation function is being correctly called and applied.
