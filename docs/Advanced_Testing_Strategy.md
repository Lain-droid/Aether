# AetherVisor: Advanced Testing Strategy for Adaptive Systems
**Version 11.0 ("Maximum Protection" Release Candidate)**

This document outlines the testing strategy for all systems within the AetherVisor project, updated to cover the final "Maximum Protection" features.

## 1. Testing Philosophy

The system is a complex, non-deterministic, adaptive, and deeply obfuscated application. Testing requires a multi-faceted approach focusing on behavioral verification, state inspection, component isolation, and functional correctness of the core algorithms.

## 2. Test Scenarios - Previous Phases (Recap)

- All previously implemented features are tested as per prior versions of this document.

## 3. Test Scenarios - Phase 8 ("Maximum Protection") Features

### 3.1. Advanced `ManualMapper`
- **Objective:** Verify the mapper can handle complex DLLs.
- **Scenario:**
    1.  Create a test DLL that uses Thread Local Storage (TLS) callbacks.
    2.  Inject this DLL using the `ManualMapper`.
    3.  **Expected Result:** The injection should succeed, and logs should confirm that the TLS callbacks were executed correctly.

### 3.2. Maximum Polymorphism (Function Encryption)
- **Objective:** Verify that the function encryption concept works.
- **Scenario:**
    1.  This feature is a conceptual placeholder. A test would involve creating a payload with an exported function, e.g., `MyFunction`.
    2.  Run the `PolymorphicEngine`'s `EncryptFunction` on this payload.
    3.  Inspect the resulting byte buffer in a disassembler.
    4.  **Expected Result:** The original assembly for `MyFunction` should be replaced with encrypted bytes, and a small decryption stub should be present at the function's original entry point.

### 3.3. Comprehensive Evasion Modules
- **Objective:** Verify the new, advanced evasion checks work as intended.
- **Scenario 1 (Hardware Breakpoints):**
    1.  Launch the backend and set a hardware breakpoint on a function using a debugger.
    2.  Call `DebugEvader::IsDebugging()`.
    3.  **Expected Result:** The function should return `true`.
- **Scenario 2 (Suspicious Uptime):**
    1.  On a VM that has been running for less than 10 minutes, launch the backend.
    2.  Call `SandboxDetector::IsInSandbox()`.
    3.  **Expected Result:** The function should return `true`.
- **Scenario 3 (Suspicious Username):**
    1.  Change the local username to "Sandbox".
    2.  Launch the backend and call `SandboxDetector::IsInSandbox()`.
    3.  **Expected Result:** The function should return `true`.
